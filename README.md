# Lighter Theme for nvALT Preview

Theme for nvALT using Avenir Next and DejaVu Sans Mono.

## Installation

Instructions available on [Brett Terpstra’s website](http://brettterpstra.com/2013/04/06/customizing-the-nvalt-preview/#installation). To quote:

> First, back up any custom files you’ve created previously. You can always restore the default style by deleting the `custom.css` and `template.html` files from `[User Home]/Library/Application Support/nvALT/`.

> Copy the files in the downloaded zip folder to `[User Home]/Library/Application Support/nvALT/`. If the “nvALT” folder doesn’t exist, create it…

> nvALT will automatically pick up this new theme even if it’s already running. After switching notes you should see the change.

You can also just clone this repository as `nvALT` into `Application Support`.
